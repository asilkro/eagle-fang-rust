Welcome to **eagle-fang-rust**, a no-nonsense repo for my personal Rust practice sessions, code katas, and simple exercises. This is where I build muscle memory, learn idioms, and mess around with different parts of the Rust programming language.

## 🧠 Purpose

This repo exists to:

- Track my Rust learning journey
- Practice core language features like ownership, lifetimes, enums, traits, and async
- Experiment with tools like `cargo`, `clippy`, `rustfmt`, and `serde`
- Serve as a personal dojo of code: swift, brutal, and improving every day

## 🛠️ Requirements

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable)
- `cargo` for building and running projects
- Optional: `clippy`, `rustfmt`, `cargo-watch`, etc.
